Hello, I‚Äôm Fabian üëã

I am a PhD student at [University of W√ºrzburg](https://www.informatik.uni-wuerzburg.de/nlp/wuenlp/), Germany. I am working on Cross-Lingual Transfer in Natural Language Processing (NLP) field under the supervision of [Prof. Goran Glava≈°](https://sites.google.com/view/goranglavas) (University of W√ºrzburg) and [Ivan Vuliƒá](https://sites.google.com/site/ivanvulic/) (University of Cambridge). My research interests are cross-lingual and multilingual representation learning, focusing on domain and language specialization methods for dialog systems with the concerns of efficient domain- and language-transfer techniques.

I received my Bachelors in Finance and gained professional experience in investment banking and private equity at, among others, Goldmach Sachs. My pivot to NLP took place in various steps. I ventured from empirical research in management accounting during my Bachelors to a Masters in Data Science at Uni Mannheim. There, I began to collaborate with my later supervisor Goran towards the end of my studies. My masters thesis on lexical supervision for low-resource neural machine translation sparked me to pursue a PhD in the field.

The first two years of my PhD focused on making both zero-shot and cross-lingual transfer to low-resource languages unseen in multilingual language modelling more robust. My interests are expanding to cross-lingual visually-grounded NLP in which I am at time of writing collaborating with another PhD in my team [Gregor](https://gregor-ge.github.io/).

In my free time, I enjoy outdoor activities, such as running üëü or hiking ‚õ∞Ô∏è ,  contributing to open-souurce projects [telescope.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim) (co-maintainer) or [telescope-file-browser.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim), which are hackable fuzzy finders for my editor of choice [Neovim](https://neovim.io).

Feel free to reach out regarding my research interests, papers, or interests on your platform of choice :)
